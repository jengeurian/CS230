Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client is The Gaming Room. They are looking to expand the popular game they already have available on Andriod to other platforms.
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  Created a document that explained all the technical requirements, design constraints, and recommendations of each platform.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Going through the design documentation first helped to get a good overview in my own mind of what the software needed to do and how the code was going to satisfy that.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I think I would go back over the development requirements and maybe try and reword how they are written to give more information in a more succinct way.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  While the customer is the one paying to have the software designed, they aren't going to get very far with their customers (the end users) if we don't keep them in mind when designing the software. Not all users have a great amount of technical ability, and for a gaming platform that needs to be kept in mind. Games are supposed to be fun, and the user isn't going to want to play the game if they need a great deal of technical knowhow to do that.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I like the way this document is broken down into specific sections, and I think that template is a good platform for future software design. Having a basic template to work from until you are more familiar with the design process is a great way to help keep all your thoughts in order and communicate the design information to the customer efficiently.
